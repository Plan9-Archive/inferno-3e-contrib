<H1>Installation of  the Inferno Software</H1>
<P>Inferno can run as either a native operating system or as a <EM>hosted </EM>virtual operating system. This
document explains how to configure the system for basic networking when installing to a hosted environment.
Third edition Inferno can run as a hosted virtual operating system on top of Plan 9, Unix or Windows. In
this document, the term <EM>Unix </EM>is used to cover all supported variants,
currently FreeBSD, Linux and Solaris, and
the term <EM>Windows </EM>covers Microsoft Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows Nt and Windows 2000.

<H2><B>1. Preparation</B></H2>

You should ensure that there are at least 100 Mbytes of free space
on the filesystem.
Skip to the appropriate section below depending upon whether
you obtain Inferno from a network download or from a CD-ROM.

<H3><B>Installing from a Network Download</B></H3>

To install the 'binary' version of Inferno from the network
you will need to download two files: the Inferno component (<TT>inferno.tgz</TT>)
and a platform component for your target machine
(For example <TT>Plan9.tgz</TT> or <TT>Nt.tgz</TT>).
<P>
The component files are in <EM>gzip</EM>ed <EM>tar</EM> format and
should both be unpacked into the same temporary directory. We will call
this directory the Inferno <EM>media</EM> directory.
<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>On Windows</B>
<DD>Unpack the files with <EM>WinZip</EM> and remember to check the
<TT>Use folder names</TT> tickbox in the WinZip Extract dialog box
otherwise the archive directory hierarchy will not be preserved.
<P>
<DT><B>On Plan 9</B>
<DD>Unpack the files with <EM>gzip</em> and <EM>tar</EM>:
<DL><DT><DD>
gunzip &lt;inferno.tgz | tar x
<BR>
gunzip &lt;Plan9.tgz | tar x
</DL>
<P>
<DT><B>On Unix or Linux</B>
<DD>Unpack the files with <EM>tar</EM> and use the <TT>-p</TT> option
to ensure that the correct file permissions are taken from the
archive file.
If your <EM>tar</EM> has no <TT>-p</TT> option,
you should run:
<DL><DT><DD>
umask 0
</DL>
to disable masking of the file permissions before running <EM>tar</EM>.
For example, to unpack the archive on Linux using the
<TT>-z</TT> option to invoke <EM>gzip</EM>:
<DL><DT><DD>
tar xzpf inferno.tgz
<BR>
tar xzpf Linux.tgz
</DL>
On systems for which <EM>tar</EM> has no <TT>-z</TT> option, you must use <EM>gzip</EM> directly:
<DL><DT><DD>
gunzip &lt;inferno.tgz | tar xpf -
<BR>
gunzip &lt;Linux.tgz | tar xpf -
</DL>
</DL>
Once you unpack the component files you should see (at least) the following
files and directories in the media directory:
<DL><DT><DD><PRE>
LICENCE
README.html		# this document
dis/
install/
</PRE></DL>
In addition, you should see a platform subdirectory, named <TT>Plan9</TT>,
<TT>Linux</TT>, or <TT>Nt</TT> depending upon which
platform component you downloaded.
<P>
Once you have completed the installation you can delete the media
directory and its contents.

<H3><B>Installing from a CD-ROM</B></H3>

To install the `binary' version of Inferno from a CD-ROM you need to find
the Inferno media directory on the CD-ROM.
Unless Inferno is sharing the CD-ROM with other software
it will be the top level directory on the CD-ROM.
<P>
The Inferno media directory is likely to contain (at least) the following
files and directories:
<DL><DT><DD><PRE>
LICENCE
Linux/
Nt/
Plan9/
README.html		# this document
dis/
install/
mnt/
n/
tmp/
</PRE></DL>

The CD-ROM can be used to install Inferno to more than one platform.
The media directory contains a subdirectory for each of the platforms
supported by the software on the CD-ROM.

<H3><B>A Note on the Media Directory</B></H3>

This directory contains a minimal Inferno <EM>root filesystem</EM>
that is used by the installation program.
The <TT>install</TT> subdirectory contains an installation program for each platform,
usually in the form of a shell script;
for Windows systems, it is a setup.exe program.
Each platform subdirectory
(<TT>Plan9</TT>, <TT>Linux</TT>, or <TT>Nt</TT>)
includes the Inferno executable
<TT>emu</TT> (or <TT>emu.exe</TT> for Windows) for that platform
in the directory:

<DL><DT><DD>
<EM>platform</EM><TT>/</TT><EM>architecture</EM><TT>/bin</TT>
</DL>

The installation script (or <TT>setup.exe</TT> on Windows) uses a cut-down
Inferno image to unpack the full installation.

<H2><B>2. Performing the Installation</B></H2>
First, read the licence in the file <TT>LICENCE</TT>.
If you do not agree to the terms and conditions
of the licence you must not install the Inferno software and should remove any downloaded Inferno files.
<P>
You need to decide on a suitable location for Inferno; if you are installing on a Windows
platform the installation program (<TT>setup.exe</TT>) will create this directory
for you, on other platforms you should ensure that the directory exists and has suitable
access permissions.
<P>
The usual Inferno installation directory is <TT>/usr/inferno</TT> for Plan 9 and Unix
systems and <TT>c:\users\inferno</TT> on Windows systems. This directory will
form the root of the Inferno filesystem; the installation program will install files
into and below this <EM>inferno_root</EM> directory.

<H3><B>Windows</B></H3>
To install Inferno on a Windows platform you should:
<OL>
<LI>Run the <TT>setup.exe</TT> program located in the <TT>install</TT>
subdirectory of the media directory.
<LI>Enter the pathname of the chosen <EM>inferno_root</EM> directory and press <TT>Enter</TT>.
</OL>
The installation program will then perform the following tasks:
<OL>
<LI>Execute <TT>Nt\386\bin\emu.exe</TT>
to unpack the Inferno and Nt components.
<LI>Copy the <TT>LICENCE</TT> file to the root of the Inferno filesystem.
<LI>Rename the file <TT>emu.new</TT> to <TT>emu.exe</TT>
in the <TT>Nt\386\bin</TT> directory of the new Inferno filesystem.
<LI>Create an entry in the Windows registry for the location of the Inferno root directory.
<LI>Create a Windows Start Menu shortcut to <TT>emu.exe</TT>
entitled: <EM>Vita Nuova Inferno</Em>.
</OL>
When installing on Windows NT or Windows 2000, the installation program determines
if the current user belongs to the
<TT>Administrators</TT>
group.
If so, the Start Menu entry is created in the
<TT>All Users</TT>
profile, otherwise it is created in the user's private profile.
On Windows 95 and Windows 98, if the user has a private profile the
Start Menu entry is created there,
otherwise it is created in the main system Start Menu.

<H3><B>Plan 9</B></H3>
To install Inferno on the Plan 9 platform you should:
<OL>
<LI>Turn permission checking off with <TT>disk/kfscmd allow</TT>.
<LI>Edit the <TT>/adm/users</TT> file.
The files in the Inferno archive have been stored with owner <TT>inferno</TT>
and group <TT>inf</TT>. To preserve the same owner and group you should add a 
user <TT>inferno</TT> and group <TT>inf</TT> to the <TT>/adm/users</TT> file.
The entries would look something like this:
<DL><DT><DD><PRE>
3:inferno:inferno:
10003:inf::inferno
</PRE></DL>
You will need to change the first number on each line to ensure that it does not clash with the number
of an existing entry.
<LI>Run <EM>kfscmd</EM> to cause <EM>kfs</EM> to re-read <TT>/adm/users</TT>.
<DL><DT><DD><PRE>
disk/kfscmd user
</PRE></DL>
<LI>Run 
<DL><DT><DD><PRE>
<TT>rc /</TT><EM>install_path</EM><TT>/install/Plan9.rc -u </TT> <EM>inferno_root</EM>
</PRE></DL>
Where <EM>install_path</EM> is the full pathname to the
media directory and <EM>inferno_root</EM> is the chosen Inferno root directory.
The installation program will then perform the following tasks:
<OL>
<LI>Execute <TT>Plan9/$cputype/bin/emu</TT>
to unpack the Inferno and Plan 9 components.
<LI>Copy the <TT>LICENCE</TT> file to the root of the Inferno filesystem.
<LI>Rename the file <TT>emu.new</TT> to <TT>emu</TT>
in the <TT>Plan9/$cputype/bin</TT> directory of the new Inferno filesystem.
</OL>
The <TT>-u</TT>
option causes the ownership and group membership of the installed files
to be taken from the archive. If you omit it, the files will be owned by you
and have group <TT>sys</TT>.
<LI>Make sure that the window is able to scroll to display the list of directories
that the installation software prints. You may need to select the <TT>scroll</TT>
option from the menu displayed when you click on the middle mouse button
in the output window to enable this.
<LI>Turn permission checking back on again with <TT>disk/kfscmd disallow</TT>.
</OL>

<H3><B>Unix or Linux</B></H3>
On Posix systems, files installed from the distribution will have
owner and group determined by the owner and group of the user
who performs the installation.
The convention, here, is to create a new user, <TT>inferno</TT>,
belonging to a new group, <TT>inf</TT> and to become that user
before installing.
<P>
To install Inferno on a Unix or Linux platform you should:
<OL>
<LI>Optionally, edit the system <EM>user</EM> and <EM>group</EM> files
(probably <TT>/etc/passwd</TT> and <TT>/etc/group</TT>)
to create
a user <TT>inferno</TT> and a group <TT>inf</TT>.
Then become user <TT>inferno</TT> with:

<DL><DT><DD><TT>su inferno</TT></DL>

<LI>Run <TT>sh /</TT><EM>install_path</EM><TT>/install/<EM>platform</EM><TT>-</TT><EM>arch</EM>.sh </TT> <EM>inferno_root</EM>.
</OL>
Where <EM>platform</EM> and <EM>arch</EM> are one of the supported combinations of
Unix variant and CPU architecture,
<EM>install_path</EM> is the full pathname to the
media directory and <EM>inferno_root</EM> is the chosen <EM>inferno_root</EM> directory.
The installation program will then perform the following tasks:
<OL>
<LI>Execute <EM>platform</EM><TT>/</TT><EM>arch</EM><TT>/bin/emu</TT>
to unpack the Inferno and <EM>platform</EM> components.
<LI>Copy the <TT>LICENCE</TT> file to the root of the Inferno filesystem.
<LI>Rename the file <TT>emu.new</TT> to <TT>emu</TT>
in the <EM>platform</EM><TT>/</TT><EM>arch</EM><TT>/bin</TT> directory of the new Inferno filesystem.
</OL>


<H2><B>3. Running Inferno</B></H2>

Inferno host executables are kept in a directory corresponding to the combination of host
operating system and CPU architecture - the Inferno <TT>bin</TT> directory.

<DL><DT><DD><EM>inferno_root</EM><TT>/</TT><EM>host_os</EM><TT>/</TT><EM>host_arch</EM><TT>/bin</TT></DL>

Plan 9 users should add a line to their <TT>lib/profile </TT>file that binds this directory after their <TT>/bin </TT>directory.

<DL><DT><DD><TT>bind -a /usr/inferno/Plan9/$cputype/bin /bin</TT></DL>

The bind is done after the existing <EM>bin </EM>directory to avoid hiding your existing Plan 9 compilers. If, at a later
stage, you build either the hosted or native Inferno kernels you should ensure that the Inferno compilers are
used rather than the Plan 9 compilers. The differences between the two compiler suites are likely to be
reduced in future releases. On Windows systems the <EM>host_os </EM>is always <TT>Nt </TT>and <EM>host_arch </EM>is always <TT>386</TT>
and the installation program will create an entry on the Start Menu to invoke Inferno. For Unix systems or
Windows systems in which Inferno will be started from a command shell, the environment variable <TT>PATH
</TT>should be set to include the Inferno <TT>bin </TT>directory. For Windows 95 and Windows 98 this should be done
in the <TT>\autoexec.bat </TT>file by adding a line like

<DL><DT><DD><TT>PATH=&quot;c:\users\inferno\Nt\386\bin&quot;;%PATH%</TT></DL>

You will need to reboot Windows to have the system re-read the <TT>\autoexec.bat </TT>file. For Windows NT
and Windows 2000 modify the <TT>Path </TT>environment variable through <EM>Control Panel -&gt; System -&gt;
Environment</EM>. For Unix this should be done in your <TT>.profile </TT>file by adding a line like
<DL><DT><DD><TT>PATH=&quot;/usr/inferno/Linux/386/bin:$PATH&quot;
</TT></DL>Don't forget to ensure that <TT>PATH </TT>is exported. You may need to log out and back in again for these changes
to take effect.

<DL><DT><DD><b>&#164; Step 1: Start Inferno.</b></DL>

Hosted inferno is run by invoking an executable called <EM>emu</EM>.
On Windows, select the Inferno option from the Start Menu. This will invoke <EM>emu </EM>with appropriate arguments to find its files in <EM>inferno_root</EM>. If you need to change any of the options passed to <EM>emu </EM>when
invoked from the Start Menu you need to do this by clicking the right mouse button on the Windows task
bar and choosing <EM>Properties -&gt; Start Menu Programs -&gt; Advanced </EM>to modify the shortcut used for Inferno.
For Unix and Plan 9, you will need to tell <EM>emu </EM>where to find the Inferno file tree by passing it the
<TT>-r</TT><EM>rootpath</EM> command line option. For example

<DL><DT><DD><TT>emu -r/usr/john/inferno</TT></DL>

Without the <TT>-r </TT>option it will look for the file tree in <TT>/usr/inferno </TT>on Plan 9 and Unix and <TT>\users\inferno </TT>on the current drive for Windows. By default, when using graphics, <EM>emu </EM>will use a
window with a resolution of 640 x 480 pixels.
To use a larger resolution you will need to pass <EM>emu </EM>the
<TT>-g</TT><EM>Xsize</EM><TT>x</TT><EM>Ysize </EM>command line option. So, for example, to invoke <EM>emu </EM>as above but with a resolution of
1024 x 768 pixels the full command line would be

<DL><DT><DD><TT>emu -r/usr/john/inferno -g1024x768</TT></DL>

When invoked in this way <EM>emu </EM>displays a command window running the Inferno shell <TT>/dis/sh.dis</TT>. To
avoid typing the command line options each time you invoke <EM>emu </EM>you can store them in the environment
variable <TT>EMU </TT>which is interrogated when <EM>emu </EM>is started and might as well be set along side the <TT>PATH </TT>environment variable if the same configuration options are to be used on each invocation.
For Windows:

<DL><DT><DD><TT>set EMU=&quot;-rd:\users\john\inferno -g1024x768&quot;</TT></DL>

For Plan 9:

<DL><DT><DD><TT>EMU=(-r/usr/john/inferno -g1024x768)</TT></DL>

For Unix:

<DL><DT><DD><TT>EMU=&quot;-r/usr/john/inferno -g1024x768&quot;</TT></DL>
	
An alternative to using the <TT>EMU </TT>environment variable is to place the correct invocation in a script
file (or batch file, for Windows) and invoke that instead of running <EM>emu </EM>directly. It is important to note that
for Windows the <TT>-r </TT>option also serves to indicate both the drive and directory on to which the software has
been installed. Without a drive letter the system will assume the current drive and will fail if the user
changes to an alternative drive. Once the environment variables or scripts are set up, as described above,
invoking

<DL><DT><DD><TT>emu</TT></DL>

or the appropriate script file, should result in output which look something like this

<DL><DT><DD><PRE>Inferno Third Edition (4 May 2000) main (pid=112260) interp
Initialize Dis: /dis/emuinit.dis
; 
</PRE></DL>

You are now running third edition Inferno, built on May 4th 2000 and the word <TT>interp </TT>means that the
Inferno Dis virtual machine is interpreting Dis instructions. You can add a further option <TT>-c1 </TT>(see the
<EM>emu</EM>(1) manual page) to cause <EM>emu </EM>to start up in <EM>compile </EM>mode in which the JIT compiler is automatically
invoked to compile all Dis operations to native machine instructions on demand. In <EM>compile </EM>mode most
programs will run significantly faster. Whether in compiled or interpreted mode you should now have a
functional hosted Inferno system. When Inferno starts the initial <TT>/dis/sh.dis </TT>it reads commands from
the file <TT>/lib/sh/profile </TT>before becoming interactive. See the manual pages for the shell <EM>sh</EM>(1) to learn
more about tailoring the initial environment. The semi-colon is the default shell prompt. From this command window you should be able to see the installed Inferno files and directories

<DL><DT><DD><TT>lc /</TT></DL>

The command <EM>lc </EM>presents the contents of its directory argument in columnar fashion to standard output in
the command window.
<DL><DT><DD><PRE>
; lc /
FreeBSD/  Plan9/    dis/      lib/       mkfiles/  nvfs/

;
</PRE></DL>

Only the files and directories in and below the <EM>inferno_root </EM>directory on the host filesystem are immediately visible to an Inferno process; these files are made visible in the root of the Inferno file namespace. If
you wish to import or export files from and to the host filesystem you will need to use tools on your host to
move them in or out of the Inferno visible portion of your host filesystem (see the manual pages <EM>os</EM>(1) and
<EM>cmd</EM>(3) for an interface to host commands). From this point onwards in this paper all file paths not qualified with <EM>inferno_root </EM>are assumed to be in the Inferno namespace. Files created in the host filesystem will
be created with the user id of the user that started <EM>emu </EM>and on Unix systems with that user's group id.

<H2><B>4. Running the <EM>wm </EM>Window Manager</B></H2>

Many Inferno programs run under the <EM>wm </EM>window manager.
Inferno has a simple editor, <EM>wm/edit</EM>,
that can be used to edit the inferno configuration files.

<DL><DT><DD><B>&#164; Step 2: Start the window manager.</B></DL>

Invoke <EM>wm </EM>by typing

<DL><DT><DD><TT>wm/wm</TT></DL>

You should see a new window open with a blue background and a small
<EM>Vita Nuova </EM>logo in the bottom left
hand corner. Click on the logo with mouse button 1 to reveal a small menu.
Selecting the <EM>Edit </EM>entry will
start <EM>wm/edit</EM>.
In common with most <EM>wm </EM>programs the editor has three small buttons
in a line at its top right hand corner. Clicking on the X button, the right most button,
will close the program down. The left most of
the three buttons will allow the window to be resized - after clicking it drag the window from a point near
to either one of its edges or one of its corners. The middle button will minimise the window, creating an
entry for it in the application bar along the bottom of the main <EM>wm </EM>window. You can restore a minimised
window by clicking on its entry in the application bar.
The initial <EM>wm </EM>configuration is determined by the
contents of the shell script <TT>/lib/wmsetup </TT>(see <EM>sh</EM>(1)).

<DL><DT><DD><B>&#164; Step 3: Open a shell window.</B></DL>

Choose the <EM>shell </EM>option from the menu to open up a shell window.
The configuration of Inferno will be done from this shell window.

<H2><B>5. Manual Pages</B></H2>

Manual pages for all of the system commands are available from a shell window. Use the <EM>man </EM>or
<EM>wm/man </EM>commands. For example,

<DL><DT><DD><TT>man wm</TT></DL>

will give information about <EM>wm</EM>. And

<DL><DT><DD><TT>man man</TT></DL>

will give information about using <EM>man</EM>. <EM>Wm/man </EM>makes use of
the Tk text widget to produce slightly more attractive output than <EM>man</EM>.
Here, and in other Inferno documentation you will see references to manual
page entries of the form <EM>command</EM><TT>(</TT><EM>section</EM><TT>)</TT>.

You can display the manual page for the command by running

<DL><DT><DD><TT>man </TT><EM>command</EM></DL>

or

<DL><DT><DD><TT>man </TT><EM>section command</EM></DL>

if the manual page appears in more than one section.

<H2><B>6. Initial Namespace</B></H2>

The initial Inferno namespace is built by placing the root device '#/' (see <EM>root</EM>(3)) at the root of the namespace and binding
<DL>
<DT><DD>i) the host filesystem device '#U' (see <EM>fs</EM>(3)) containing the <EM>inferno_root </EM>subtree of the host filesystem at the root of the Inferno filesystem,
<DT><DD>ii) the console device '#c' (see <EM>cons</EM>(3)) in <TT>/dev</TT>,
<DT><DD>iii) the prog device '#p' (see <EM>prog</EM>(3)) onto <TT>/prog</TT>,
<DT><DD>iv) the IP device '#I' (see <EM>ip</EM>(3)) in <TT>/net</TT>, and
<DT><DD>v) the environment device '#e' (see <EM>env</EM>(3)) at <TT>/dev/env</TT>.
</DL>
You can see the sequence of commands required to construct the current namespace by running

<DL><DT><DD><TT>ns</TT></DL>

To use IP networking, the IP device (<EM>ip</EM>(3)) must have been bound into <TT>/net</TT>. Typing

<DL><DT><DD><TT>ls -l /net</TT></DL>

(see <EM>ls</EM>(1)) should result in something like

<DL><PRE>
<DT><DD>dr-xr-xr-x I    0 bootes bootes 0 Feb 02 14:48 /net/tcp
<DT><DD>dr-xr-xr-x I    1 bootes bootes 0 Feb 02 14:48 /net/udp
</PRE></DL>

We can now configure Inferno to allow secure connections to other Inferno systems. First we will start a
signer process which will generate certificates for both the system making a connection and the system
receiving the connection. If there is only one machine in your Inferno network then the same machine will
be user as client, server and certificate signer.

<H2><B>7. Connection Server</B></H2>

The connection server (see <EM>cs</EM>(8) and <EM>db</EM>(6)) translates symbolic network names and services into
instructions for connecting to a given service. The file <TT>/services/cs/db </TT>defines a mapping from
machine names of the form <TT>$</TT><EM>service </EM>to either a network address or a numeric address. The connection
server will convert such a machine name using this file into either a numeric address or a machine name. A
typical <TT>/services/cs/db </TT>file will look something like this

<DL><PRE>
<DT><DD>$SIGNER          doppio
<DT><DD>$FILESERVER      rotta
<DT><DD>$MAILSERVER      doppio
<DT><DD>$PROXY           pox
</PRE></DL>

Network and service names are passed through to the host for conversion to numeric addresses and port
numbers. If the host is unable to convert a service name the connection server will attempt to convert the
name using mappings of service and protocol names to Internet port numbers in the file
<TT>/services/cs/services </TT>which should contain at least the following entries

<DL><PRE>
<DT><DD>styx        6666/tcp          # Main file service
<DT><DD>mpeg        6667/tcp          # Mpeg stream
<DT><DD>rstyx       6668/tcp          # Remote invocation
<DT><DD>infdb       6669/tcp          # Database connection
<DT><DD>infweb      6670/tcp          # inferno web server
<DT><DD>infsigner   6671/tcp          # inferno signing services
<DT><DD>infcsigner  6672/tcp          # inferno signing services
<DT><DD>inflogin    6673/tcp          # inferno login service
<DT><DD>virgil      2202/udp virgild  # inferno info
</PRE></DL>

For the moment, leave this file as it is. You will need to modify this file, at some point in the future, if you
add new services to Inferno and want to refer to them by name.

<DL><DT><DD><B>&#164; Step 4: Start the connection server.</B></DL>

To run the connection server, type

<DL><DT><DD><TT>lib/cs</TT></DL>

You should now see a new file in the <TT>/net </TT>directory called <TT>cs</TT>. Run the command

<DL><DT><DD><TT>ls /net</TT></DL>

You should see the following output

<DL><PRE>
<DT><DD>/net/cs
<DT><DD>/net/tcp
<DT><DD>/net/udp
</PRE></DL>

Before an Inferno machine can establish a connection to an Inferno service on another machine, each needs
to obtain a certificate from a common signer. To bootstrap this process we will configure this machine as a
signer.
<H2><B>8. Network Services</B></H2>
The command <EM>srv </EM>is used to start listeners for local network servers (see <EM>srv</EM>(8)). <EM>Srv </EM>starts a listener
for each service configured in <TT>/services/server/config</TT>.

<DL><PRE>
<DT><DD>S infsigner    tcp /dis/lib/signer.dis 
<DT><DD>S infcsigner   tcp /dis/lib/countersigner.dis
<DT><DD>S inflogin     tcp /dis/lib/logind.dis 
<DT><DD>S styx         tcp /dis/lib/styxd.dis nossl clear sha md5 rc4 sha/rc4
<DT><DD>S rstyx        tcp /dis/lib/rstyxd.dis nossl clear sha md5 rc4 sha/rc4
<DT><DD>S infdb        tcp /dis/lib/dbsrv.dis    nossl clear sha md5 rc4 sha/rc4
<DT><DD>S virgil       udp /dis/lib/virgild.dis
<DT><DD>M 67           udp /dis/lib/bootp.dis
<DT><DD>M 69           udp /dis/lib/tftpd.dis
</PRE></DL>

Documentation for these servers can be found in section 8 of the Programmers Manual (Volume 1). Start the listeners on this machine by running <EM>srv</EM>.

<DL><DT><DD><B>&#164; Step 5: Start the network listener services.</B></DL>

Type

<DL><DT><DD><TT>lib/srv</TT></DL>

Your servers will now be running. To confirm this type

<DL><DT><DD><TT>netstat</TT></DL>

<EM>Netstat </EM>prints information about network connections. You should see several lines of output, each one
describing an announced TCP or UDP service. Depending upon the contents of your
<TT>/services/server/config </TT>file you should see something which looks like this

<DL><PRE>
<DT><DD>tcp/0     inferno     200.1.1.89!6669       0.0.0.0!0       Announced
<DT><DD>tcp/1     inferno     200.1.1.89!6668       0.0.0.0!0       Announced
<DT><DD>tcp/2     inferno     200.1.1.89!6666       0.0.0.0!0       Announced
<DT><DD>tcp/3     inferno     200.1.1.89!6673       0.0.0.0!0       Announced
<DT><DD>tcp/4     inferno     200.1.1.89!6672       0.0.0.0!0       Announced
<DT><DD>tcp/5     inferno     200.1.1.89!6671       0.0.0.0!0       Announced
<DT><DD>udp/0     inferno     200.1.1.89!2202       0.0.0.0!0       Announced
</PRE></DL>

Each line corresponds to a network connection: the connection name, the name of the user running the
server, the address of the local end of the connection, the address of the remote end of the connection, and
the connection status. The connection name is actually the protocol and conversation directory in <TT>/net</TT>.
The connection addresses are all of the form <EM>host</EM><TT>!</TT><EM>port </EM>for these IP based services, and the remote
addresses are not filled in because they all represent listening services that are in the <TT>Announced </TT>state. In
this example the fourth line shows a TCP service listening on port 6673. Examining
<TT>/services/cs/services </TT>with <TT>grep </TT>(see <EM>grep</EM>(1)) shows that the listener on port 6673 is the Inferno
login service.

<DL><DT><DD><TT>grep 6673 /services/cs/services</TT></DL>

gives

<DL><PRE>
<DT><DD>inflogin     6673/tcp          # inferno login service
</PRE></DL>

Before the signing service can be used to generate certificates some configuration is required. The signer
needs a public and private key-pair and a database of user names and passwords.

<H2><B>9. Configuring a Signer</B></H2>

To use authenticated connections we need to set up a signer to generate certificates for users (see
<EM>createsignerkey</EM>(8) and <EM>signer</EM>(8)). For two machines to communicate securely they must both have
obtained a certificate from the same signer. Choose an Inferno machine to become the signer. If this is the
first or only Inferno machine on your network then make this machine the signer.

<DL><DT><DD><B>&#164; Step 6: Generate a signer key.</B></DL>

On the signer machine run

<DL><DT><DD><TT>lib/createsignerkey </TT><EM>name</EM></DL>

In place of <EM>name </EM>enter the network name of the signer. This value will appear as the signer name in each
certificate generated by the signer. <EM>Createsignerkey </EM>creates public and private keys that are used by the
signer when generating certificates.

<DL><DT><DD><B>&#164; Step 7: Enter user names and secrets.</B></DL>

For each user to be authenticated by the signer run

<DL><DT><DD><TT>changelogin </TT><EM>username</EM></DL>

You will be prompted to supply a secret (i.e. password) and expiration date. The expiration date will be
used as the expiration date of certificates generated for that user. <EM>Changelogin </EM>(see <EM>changelogin</EM>(8)) will
create and update entries in the file <TT>/keydb/password</TT>. For the signer to generate a certificate there
must be at least one entry in the password file. If you are not sure at this stage of the names of the users
that you want to authenticate then create an entry for the user <TT>inferno</TT>.

<H2><B>10. Establishing a Secure Connection</B></H2>

To establish a secure connection between two machines, each needs to have a certificate signed by a common signer (which need not be a third machine). If you have only one Inferno machine you can experiment with secure connections by making the same machine signer, server and client.

<DL><DT><DD><B>&#164; Step 8: Generate a server certificate.</B></DL>

On the server machine, ensure that <TT>lib/cs </TT>is running. You will need it if you refer to your signer by hostname instead of IP address. If in doubt, or if it is not running, type

<DL><DT><DD><TT>lib/cs</TT></DL>

On the server machine, use <EM>getauthinfo</EM>(8) to obtain a certificate and save it in a file named <TT>default </TT>by running

<DL><DT><DD><TT>getauthinfo default</TT></DL>

<EM>Getauthinfo </EM>will prompt for the address of your signer and for a remote username and password combination. <EM>Getauthinfo </EM>will connect to the <EM>inflogin </EM>service on the signer and authenticate you against its user and
password database, <TT>/keydb/password</TT>, using the username and password that you entered. Answer
<TT>Yes </TT>to the question that asks if you want to save the certificate in a file. <EM>Getauthinfo </EM>will save a certificate
in the file <TT>/usr/</TT><EM>user</EM><TT>/keyring/default </TT>where <EM>user </EM>is the name in <TT>/dev/user</TT>.

<DL><DT><DD><B>&#164; Step 9: Generate a client certificate.</B></DL>

Obtain a certificate for the client in the same way. Type

<DL><DT><DD><TT>getauthinfo default</TT></DL>

If you wish you can obtain a certificate for use with a specific server by storing it in a file whose name
exactly matches the network address of the server

<DL><DT><DD><TT>getauthinfo tcp!</TT><EM>hostname</EM></DL>

<EM>Getauthinfo </EM>stores the certificate in the file <TT>/usr/</TT><EM>user</EM><TT>/keyring/</TT><EM>keyname </EM>where <EM>user </EM>is the name in
<TT>/dev/user </TT>and <EM>keyname </EM>is the argument given to <EM>getauthinfo</EM>. Again, answer <TT>Yes </TT>to the question that
asks if you want to save the certificate in a file. Now that both client and server have a certificate obtained
from the same signer it is possible to establish a secure connection between them. If you have only one
Inferno system you can still test the configuration by using the same machine as both client and server.
Alternatively, start a second copy of <EM>emu </EM>on the same machine and treat one as the server and one as the
client.

<DL><DT><DD><B>&#164; Step 10: Make an authenticated connection.</B></DL>

On the server, make sure that <EM>srv </EM>is running, type

<DL><DT><DD><TT>netstat</TT></DL>

you should see a line for the TCP service listening on port 6666.

<DL><PRE>
<DT><DD>tcp/2     inferno     200.1.1.89!6666       0.0.0.0!0       Announced
</PRE></DL>

If you do not see any output, start <EM>srv </EM>by running

<DL><DT><DD><TT>lib/srv</TT></DL>

The listener on port 6666 is expecting to serve the Inferno file protocol <EM>Styx </EM>to export a namespace.

<DL><DT><DD><TT>grep 6666 /services/cs/services</TT></DL>

Gives
<DL><DT><DD><PRE>styx        6666/tcp          # Main file service</PRE></DL>

The line for the <EM>styx </EM>service in the file <TT>/services/server/config </TT>shows that the server
<TT>/dis/lib/styxd.dis </TT>is listening on port 6666. The namespace that <EM>styxd </EM>serves is the one that it inherited when it was started with <EM>srv</EM>.

On the client, make sure that <EM>Cs </EM>is running by typing

<DL><DT><DD><TT>lib/cs</TT></DL>

Now that <TT>lib/cs </TT>is running on the client and <TT>lib/srv </TT>is running on the server you can test the service.
On the client, confirm that <TT>/n/remote </TT>is an empty directory with

<DL><DT><DD><TT>lc /n/remote</TT></DL>

On the client, you can now mount the namespace that <EM>styxd </EM>is serving on the server onto the client directory
<TT>/n/remote </TT>by typing

<DL><TT>
<DT><DD>mount    tcp!</TT><EM>serveraddr </EM><TT>/n/remote
</TT></DL>

Where <EM>serveraddr </EM>is the IP address of the server or a name which the host can resolve to the IP address of the server. Now

<DL><DT><DD><TT>lc /n/remote</TT></DL>

should reveal the files and directories in the namespace being served by <EM>styxd</EM>.
Those files are now also visible in the namespace of your shell.
You will notice that these changes only affect the shell in which you
ran the <EM>mount </EM>command - other processes are unaffected.
You can create, remove or modify files and directories in and under <TT>/n/remote </TT>much as you can any other file or directory in your namespace. In fact, in
general, a process does not need to know whether a file actually resides locally or remotely.
You can unmount the mounted directory with <EM>unmount</EM>. Type

<DL><DT><DD><TT>unmount /n/remote</TT></DL>

You can confirm that it has gone by running

<DL><DT><DD><TT>ls /n/remote</TT></DL>

All connections made by Inferno are authenticated. The default connection made by <EM>mount </EM>is authenticated
but does not use SSL. The arguments passed to <EM>styxd </EM>in its entry in <TT>/services/server/config
</TT>

<DL><PRE>
<DT><DD>S rstyx       tcp /dis/lib/rstyxd.dis nossl clear sha md5 rc4 sha/rc4
</PRE></DL>

define the different combinations of security algorithms that <EM>styxd </EM>is prepared to accept. You can pass an
argument to <EM>mount </EM>to specify a more secure connection. The <TT>-C </TT>option to <EM>mount </EM>can be used to specify a hashing and an encryption algorithm
to be applied to the connection.

<DL><DT>
<DD><B>&#164; Step 11: Make a secure authenticated connection.
</B></DL>

For example,

<DL><TT>
<DT><DD>mount    -C sha/rc4 tcp!</TT><EM>serveraddr </EM><TT>/n/remote
</TT></DL>

will make an authenticated connection to the machine given by <EM>serveraddr </EM>using SHA hashing for message
digesting and RC4 for encryption and mount the namespace served by the
server's <EM>styx </EM>service on the client
directory <TT>/n/remote</TT>.


<H2><B>11. Adding new users</B></H2>

Every inferno process has an associated <EM>user name</EM>.
At boot time the user name is set equal to your
login name on the host operating system.
You can change the user name by writing the new user name to
the file <TT>/dev/user</TT>. This is a one time operation; once the user name has been changed from the original
it cannot be changed again in that process. The user name is used to select the directory in which programs
like <EM>mount </EM>search for certificates. When you attach to a server on another system the user name is passed
across to the remote system as part of the attach procedure allowing the remote system to assign the correct
ownership to files created on the remote server. The <EM>wm </EM>window manager program <EM>wm/logon </EM>allows a user
to login to the local Inferno system before running the main window manager program <EM>wm/wm</EM>.

<DL><DT><DD><B>&#164; Step 12: Re-start Inferno.</B></DL>

You should now close down any instances of <EM>emu </EM>that you are currently running. The quickest way to do
this is to type <EM>control-c </EM>in the emu window in which you ran <EM>wm/wm</EM>. Start a new <EM>emu</EM>, as before, by either
running

<DL><DT><DD><TT>emu</TT></DL>

or by choosing the appropriate entry from your Start Menu on Windows machines.
This time, run

<DL><DT><DD><TT>wm/logon</TT></DL>

and log in as user <EM>inferno</EM>. When you log in <EM>wm/logon </EM>will change directory to <TT>/usr/inferno </TT>and then
write the name <TT>inferno </TT>to <TT>/dev/user</TT>. If this is the first time that you have logged on as user <EM>inferno
</EM>to this machine it will display a licence. If the file <TT>/usr/inferno/namespace </TT>exists it will be used to
construct a new namespace for the user based on the commands that it contains (see <EM>newns</EM>(2)). <EM>Logon </EM>will
then will then start <EM>wm/wm</EM>.

<H2><B>12. What next</B></H2>

You should now have a fully functional Inferno system. You will need to have a three button mouse to use <EM>acme</EM>, <EM>wm</EM>, or <EM>plumbing</EM>.
To learn more you could start with the manual pages for:
<EM>intro</EM>(1), <EM>emu</EM>(1), <EM>wm</EM>(1),
<EM>wm-misc</EM>(1), <EM>sh</EM>(1),
<EM>acme</EM>(1), and <EM>limbo</EM>(1)
and also the papers in sections 1, 2 and 3 of volume two of the Inferno Programmer's Manual.
