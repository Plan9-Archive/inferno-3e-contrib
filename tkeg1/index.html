<h3> TK Examples </h3>

These two programs from <a href="mailto:tad@vampira.csh.rit.edu">Tad Hunt</a> show how to create
a scrollable entry widget and also how to display a list of windows.

<h4>Scrollable Entry Widget</h4>


Oftentimes, you may want an entry widget that is a certain number of
characters wide, and you want to allow an arbitrary length input into
it.  There is a problem: There is no way to scroll back and forth to
see the text that has scrolled out of view.
<p>
The attached Limbo program, "EScroll" is an example of how to
implement scrollable entry widgets.
<p>

Compile it with "limbo -gw escroll.b".
<p>

When you run it, it will open a new window containing nothing except
the titlebar and an entry widget.  Enter enough text in the window to
cause it to scroll.
<p>

Holding the left mouse button down while moving left or right will
cause the entry widget to scroll so the text to the left or right,
respectively will become visible.

<h4>Window List</h4>


The attached limbo program uses the Tk builtin module to get a list of
all of the current windows, which it traverses and prints out
<p>
        window-id: (minx, miny) (maxx, maxy)
<p>
for each window.  This is useful to come up with '-x %x -y %y' command
line options to place the windows popped up from the start menu where
you like them.  It is trivial to extend it to output width and height
for each window as well.
<p>
It will report 'nil image' for any windows that are hidden in the task
bar.
