** KNOWN BUGS AND TO DO **

- Bugs in hextile encoding

- Try to implement the copy-rectangle method (though it's coded, there
  is no way to detect window moves from /dev/draw device ou Inferno
  wm). 

- add a password window in VNCclient.b 

- internationalize to english comments and menus.

- Enhance server encoding method selection

__________________________________________________
** CHANGES **

15/02/2001 :

- README and INSTALL are added to the sources. 

- changing 'net' to 'tcp' in connecte() in VNCclient.b since Inferno
  v3 doesn't use tcp as net default.

13/09/1999 :

- The code is very imperfect but I have to finalize my report, so
let's freeze the code.

25/08/1999 :

- Add Hextile, RRE and coRRE encodings


15/06/1999 :
- Starting the VNC client and server for Inferno from scratch
