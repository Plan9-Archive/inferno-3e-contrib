<h3>Threads and Processes in Limbo</h3>

Threads in Limbo feel more like processes in other
languages. The reason for this is that the Limbo language makes it easy
to forget that you are sharing memory space with other threads.
<p>
Note that Limbo does not distinguish between threads and processes:
<i>all</i> processes in the system can potentially share memory (but the
language makes that safe, in general).  the reason is that
Limbo/Inferno does not provide a fork() primitive, but spawn, which is
exactly like calling a function except that the function gets called in
a new process.
<P>
A channel is similar to a pipe, except that it's unidirectional, and
typed. passing a value down a channel is exactly equivalent to passing
the same value as an argument to a function (i.e. the value itself is
copied, but if it points to something modifiable, then the process at
the other end is at liberty to modify it).
<P>
in a C style environment, with pointers lurking all around the place,
this model would be fairly dangerous, but Limbo provides guarantees
that ensure that certain data types are <i>not</i> modifiable once you've
given them away.
<P>
The most important is probably the string type.  Strings in Limbo are
modifiable in place (in the same way as you can modify an integer
variable) but they are assigned by value (for efficiency, this is
implemented with copy-on-write). So if you pass a string down a
channel, it incurs no more overhead than passing any pointer, but you
know that the process at the other end cannot under any circumstances
modify your local copy of that string.
<P>
Lists are also very important: in particular, note that you cannot
alter elements of a list, and that the list primitives do not alter a
list in place, but instead notionally create a new list with one more
(::) or one less (tl) element.
<P>

This means that if you have a list of a by-value type, then you can
pass it down a channel with the absolute guarantee that the process at
the other end cannot alter your copy of the list. The overhead of
passing it is just the copying of a pointer. No copy-on-write is
necessary, as lists are not modifiable. Reference counting deals with
the garbage collection easily, as it's not possible to make a
self-referential list.
<P>

In this way, if I pass (say) a list of string to another process then i
can ignore synchronisation issues between the two processes, even
though all the memory in the list is shared between the two processes.
<P>
That's not to say that all data structures act in this by-value way.
For instance, you might have a pipeline of processes, each modifying a
data structure and passing it on. the synchronisation is implicit in
the "ownership" of the data structure, and the use of channels makes it
easy.
<P>

Here's a little example that demonstrates that technique;
it adds all the integers from 1 to 100.
