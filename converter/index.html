<H3>Inferno Contribution: converter</H3>
This example illustrates how to write a Limbo program to provide a
service which accepts requests from multiple processes.

<p>
A previous contribution from Roger Peppe showed how to use file2chan to provide
a service based on a single file, but it would get confused if it was used by more
than one process at once.
<p>
The example here shows how to use the FID returned by file2chan to handle
multiplexed requests from any number of  processes.
 <p>
There are two modules, <b>converts.b</b> (a generalized service module) and
<b>degrees.b</b> (an example converter module).

<h3>converts.b</h3>

This module also implements a "conversion service", ie one which takes a string written to
a single file, and returns a new string based on the old one. Because it can be used by
multiple simultaneous processes, the  file must be held open for reading and writing
by the process making use of it.
<p>
The module is invoked with two arguments:
<ol>
<li> The name of the file to be served, eg /chan/temp
<li> The converter module, eg degrees.dis
</ol>
Eg
<pre>
% converts /chan/temp degrees.dis
</pre>

Whenever the served  file is written to by a user, the converter module
is called to find the reply, and this is stored (in the list <b>replist</b>).
When the user reads back the file, the correct reply is located, returned
to the user and is
deleted from the stored list.

<p>
When the served file is closed by the user, any associated reply is discarded.

<h3>degrees.b</h3>

This is a very simple module which provides a temperature conversion
facility. It will convert degrees Fahrenheit to degrees Centigrade and
vice-versa.
<p>
This module could be replaced by any other module with the
same signature (as defined in the template in <b>converter_tmpl.m</b>).
<p>

<h3>Installation and Testing using the shell</h3>

To try out this example, download the three files and compile
the two Limbo modules:
<pre>
% limbo converts.b degrees.b
</pre>
Now run the convertor:
<pre>
% converts /chan/temp degrees.dis
</pre>

If you want to test this using the shell, it is slightly more complicated
than just echoing a string to the file and reading it back again, because
the file has to be held open. The way to do this is to use the <> operator
to open the standard input for both reading and writing, echo a string
to this file and read back the result with cat:

<pre>
% { echo 10F >[1=0] ; cat } <> /chan/temp
</pre>

This should produce the following reply:
<pre>
10.00 deg F = -12.22 deg C
</pre>
