<H3>Inferno Contribution: bounce</H3>
A mesmerising 2D bouncing ball demo. There are 20 balls, each
independently controlled by its own Limbo process. Each ball has its
own velocity and its own colour and follows its own trajectory. You can
use the mouse to draw lines which the balls will then bounce off.  It
uses a Tk canvas widget to animate the balls, which allows the code to
be quite compact - just over 200 lines for the whole thing.
<p>
Note: this version (installed 22 Nov 2000) has various improvements on the original.
It works well in both compiled and emulation mode, and is no longer dependent on
the scheduling in the host operating system.
